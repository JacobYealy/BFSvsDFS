# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a DFS algorithm and a BFS algorithm that can traverse an input csv file.
If the file is not found, the program will end gracefully. Also, if the BFS or DFS implementations cannot reach
the target value, the program will tell you so.
## Instructions:
* To make sure that your input csv file can run, place it in the same local directory as the project.
