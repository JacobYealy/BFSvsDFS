# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a DFS algorithm and a BFS algorithm that can traverse an input csv file.
If the file is not found, the program will let you know the file is invalid and exit.
## Instructions:
* To make sure that your input csv file can run, place it in the same local directory as the project.
* Ensure that the start and end nodes you choose are valid.

# Testing:
* Functionality of testing is dependent on the BFS_DFS.csv file included in the repository.
* This is due to the fact that we must know the paths to test if the algorithms work, so the test file cannot be generic.
* BFS, DFS, and invalid nodes are tested within the test_algorithms.py file.
* Input validation is tested in the test_input.py file.
